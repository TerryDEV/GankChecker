# GankChecker v0.1
Checks recent losing sprees of enemy League of Legends players. Written in Python 3.4. Work in progress.

### Why use GankChecker?
With GankChecker you can view the ranks, sprees and champion statistics of your enemy opononents. If you are ingame, run GC and view which of your enemies is on a big losing spree so you can camp his or her lane. Or maybe the enemy adc has a 4W 12L ratio so you can camp him too. It's a secret boosting tool ;)
